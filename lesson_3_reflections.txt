Adding a file directly to GitHub Repository as the first reflection of Lesson 3

Reflect: Using a remote repository
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working as a part of a team
When you are working from multiple fixed computers
When you want to preserve your code in the cloud for safe keeping
When you want to share you code with the WORLD!
