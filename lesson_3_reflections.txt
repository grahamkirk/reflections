Adding a file directly to GitHub Repository as the first reflection of Lesson 3

Reflect: Using a remote repository
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you are working as a part of a team
When you are working from multiple fixed computers
When you want to preserve your code in the cloud for safe keeping
When you want to share you code with the WORLD!

Reflect: Manual vs. automatic pull
Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you may be working and don't want your files automatically changing to older versions on remote.

Reflect: Forks, Clones, and Branches
Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Branches - Occur on the local machine in the same repository
Forks - Occur in GitHub by creating a copy of another person's repository
Clones - From one Repository to another where both are on local machine or the source repository is on GitHub and the destination is local
