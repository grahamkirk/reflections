Reflect: Initializing a Repository
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It adds the .git metadata directory into the folder and creating the repository.  This is needed to get git ready for tracking changes within that directory.

Reflect: Staging Area
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area allows individual files to be added into a single commit allowing concepts to be separated into different logical commits.
The staging area is different from the working directory because the working directory contains all active files. The repository only contains the committed files.
